# Student Progress

As a mentor, my top priority is to ensure that all 20 students are able to complete the bootcamp and make progress towards their goals. In order to address the 5 students who are lagging behind, I would take the following steps:

1. __One-on-one meetings:__ I would schedule individual meetings with each of the 5 lagging students to understand their specific challenges and help them come up with a plan to get back on track.

2. __Identify barriers:__ During the one-on-one meetings, I would work with the students to identify any barriers that may be preventing them from making progress. This could include issues with their study habits, work schedules, or technical difficulties.

3. __Create a customized action plan:__ Based on the barriers identified in step 2, I would help each student create a customized action plan that outlines the steps they need to take in order to get back on track. This plan could include things like setting aside dedicated study time, seeking additional resources or support, or adjusting their workload.

4. __Follow-up and accountability:__ I would follow up with the students regularly to track their progress and hold them accountable to the action plans they have created.

In order to address the 10 students who are at risk of falling behind, I would take the following steps:

1. __Early intervention:__ I would reach out to each of these students as soon as possible to proactively address any potential challenges before they become bigger problems.

2. __Provide resources and support:__ I would provide these students with any additional resources or support they need to complete their next task on time. This could include things like additional study materials, access to online resources, or extra time with a tutor.

3. __Encourage collaboration:__ I would encourage these students to work together and collaborate with their peers to help each other stay on track.

4. __Set clear expectations:__ I would set clear expectations for the students regarding the importance of completing their next task on time and emphasize the consequences of falling behind.

Finally, in order to ensure that the 5 students who are ahead are not negatively impacted, I would:

1. __Provide additional challenges:__ I would provide these students with additional challenges and opportunities to deepen their learning and continue to make progress.

2. __Foster a sense of community:__ I would encourage these students to share their knowledge and expertise with their peers and foster a sense of community among all 20 students in the bootcamp.

By implementing these steps, I am confident that I will be able to help all 20 students make progress towards their goals and successfully complete the bootcamp.
