# Student Progress

As a mentor, my top priority is to ensure that all 20 students can complete the bootcamp and make
progress towards their goals. To address the 5 students who are falling behind, I would take the
following steps:

1. **One-on-one meetings:** I would schedule individual meetings with each of the 5 lagging students
   to understand their specific challenges and help them come up with a plan to get back on track.

2. **Identify barriers:** During the one-on-one meetings, I would work with the students to identify
   any barriers that may be preventing them from making progress. This could include issues with their
   study habits, work schedules, or technical difficulties.

3. **Create a customized action plan:** Based on the barriers identified in step 2, I would help each
   student create a customized action plan that outlines the steps they need to take to get back on track.
   This plan could include setting aside dedicated study time, seeking additional resources or adjusting
   their workload.

4. **Follow-up and accountability:** I would follow up with the students regularly to track their
   progress and hold them accountable for the action plans they have created.

5. **Encourage the student to ask for help:** I would encourage the students to ask for help if they're
   struggling with any aspect of the bootcamp. It could include asking for help from their peers, requesting
   support from a mentor, or asking for additional resources on a topic they're struggling to understand.

To address the 10 students who are at risk of falling behind, I would take the following steps:

1. **Early intervention:** I would reach out to each of these students as soon as possible to
   proactively address any potential challenges before they become bigger problems.

2. **Provide resources and support:** I would provide these students with any additional resources
   or support they need to complete their next task on time. This could include things like additional
   study materials, access to online resources, or advising them on how to prioritize their workload.

3. **Encourage collaboration:** I would encourage these students to work together and collaborate with
   their peers to help each other stay on track.

4. **Set clear expectations:** I would set clear expectations for the students regarding the importance of
   completing their next task on time and emphasize the consequences of falling behind.

Finally, to ensure that the 5 students who are ahead will not get negatively impacted, I would:

1. **Commend their progress:** I would commend these students' progress and encourage them to continue
   working hard.

2. **Provide additional challenges:** I would provide these students with extra challenges and opportunities
   to deepen their learning and continue to make progress.

3. **Foster a sense of community:** I would encourage these students to share their knowledge and expertise
   with their peers and foster a sense of community among all the students in the bootcamp.

<br />

By implementing these steps, I am confident that I will be able to help all 20 students make progress towards
their goals and to complete the bootcamp.
