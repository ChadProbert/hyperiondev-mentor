# Code Review

## Correctness

There is a flaw on line 9 of your code, the "sorted()" function is missing an argument. Consider passing the
"i" argument to the sorted() function to fix this issue.

The indention in lines 5 through to line 19 has not been done correctly, causing the code to not run properly.

Please have a look at the PEP 8 style guide for Python to learn more about the best practices for indentation to fix this issue.

<br />

## Efficiency

The efficiency of the code is Excellent! Good work here.

<br />

## Style

**There are a few opportunities for you to improve the style of your code:**

Indent the code consistently, use 4 spaces for each level of indentation.

Use meaningful and descriptive variable names, such as "solution" instead of "ob1" (Line 21).

Leave 2 blank lines after higher-level functions as well as after classes.

Use lowercase words separated by underscores for function and variable names instead of mixedCase. This can be changed
in line 3 of your code where you named the function "groupAnagrams".

Please have a look at the PEP 8 style guide for Python to learn more about the best practices for naming conventions.

<br />

## Documentation

The code does not contain any comments to describe the purpose and implementation details of the code. Adding docstrings or comments can help others understand the code better and make maintenance easier.

<br />

# Positive Aspects

The code is short and straightforward, making it easy to understand.
Once the minor errors are fixed, the code is functional, efficient and up to high standards.

<br />

# Opportunities For Improvement

Correct the error on line 9 by adding an argument to the "sorted()" function.

Learn more about indentation and naming conventions to improve the style of the code.

Add comments or docstrings to explain the purpose and implementation details of the code.

<br />

# Summary

Overall, the code is a good start, but it requires a few improvements to make it functional and maintainable. Keep up the good work!
