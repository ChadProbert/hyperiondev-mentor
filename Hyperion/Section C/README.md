## Worst-case space complexity ðŸ“ˆ

The worst-case space complexity of this code is __O(1)__, as the size of the data that needs to be stored does not 
depend on the size of the input "n". 

The code uses a fixed number of variables to store intermediate results, and the size of the final result string 
is also a constant, as it only needs to store a limited number of words for the digits in "n". The memory usage 
of the code is independent of the size of "n", so its space complexity is constant, or O(1).
